# Visual Elements of Design

## Line

## Color 

- It is used to create emphasis , provide organization, look & feel to the design. 
- It makes use of color theory, [View Color Theory](./color.md) for detailed explanation.

### Classification of Colors

- Primary Colors: Red, Yellow, Blue
- Secondary Colors: Green, Orange, Purple
- Tertiary Colors: Red-Orange, Orange-Yellow, Yellow-Green, Green-Blue, Blue-Purple, Purple-Red

**Cool Colors:** The colors ranging from Yellow-Green) to Violet.

**Warm Colors:** The colors ranging from Violet-Red to Yellow

### Color Rules

> Monochromatic (Shades/Tints of Same Color)
>
> Analogous
>
> > They lie next to each other or have similar origins.
> > They are balanced, and work well together.
> > They provide more contrast than monochromatic.
>
> Complimentary
>
> > The are at the opposite end of the wheel.
> > They provide high contrast.
> > The create vibrant, exciting color schemes
>
> Triadic
>
> > The colors are spaced equally in the color wheel.
> >
> > These produce vibrant effects.

##  Shape

Everything is ultimately a shape. In graphic design, shapes have two dimensions: height & width.

The shapes are defined by boundaries: lines, color and even negative space.*Negative space is, quite simply, the space that surrounds an object in a image. Just as important as that object itself, negative space helps to define the boundaries of positive space and brings balance to a composition.*

The shapes 

* add substance/interest to a graphic piece of work.
* decorate, symbolic, patterns/textures.

There are two kinds of shapes in Graphic Design:

**Geometric:**  the ones that can be drawn using a ruler/compass. They produce a feeling of control or order.

**Organic:** The shaper drawn free handedly or seem more natural. They produce a natural feel.

Shapes are single visual elements and when we begin to bring shapes together, we begin to create a visual relationship between them. This relationship can convey a message, trigger a feeling, generate enthusiasm, engage audience, add emphasis to a portion of layout or create a movement. 

When we move shapes closer/farther, we apply a design principle called **Proximity**. It plays an important role when working with shapes.

Organic & Geometric shapes can combine together on many levels to create various design elements we use to communicate. 

### Logos 

In logos, shape in used in its purest form. 
Logos can be made using only geometrical shapes, or organic shapes or combination of both. 

If you see at a typical logo, you will notice some logos have solid shapes, and some others are composed of a few shapes placed near each other. If you move a shape away/closer, it will have entirely different look & feel.

In logos, shape is used as a symbol.

### Typography

 A single letter in a typeface is a combination of geometric and organic shape build together to create a larger shape.
We are told this particular letter has a meaning combined with others gives it a new meaning.

Nowhere else in design is shape used more literally to communicate visually than in typography. It is the type of shape that combines together, giving typeface a distinct look and feel.

Shape here again is used as a symbol. Shape is an individual element but as a group shapes can form compositions and as such be treated as visual elements. 

*Shape is the foundation of any composition.* A layout can be 

1. **simple** - made of one or few other shapes.
2. **complex** - made of many individual shapes, used in many ways.

It is how shapes are arranged determines their visual outcome. When creating a composition you must always consider how visual elements of your design are creating shapes, how they interact and work together to communicate and present the intended message.

## Texture

Texture is the way the surface feels or is perceived to feel. It is used to create a visual tone and can influence look and feel of Graphic Design Element.

It is used to attract or repel interest to an element depending  on pleasantness of text. There are two types of textures: 
Image Textures, Pattern Textures.

### Image Textures 

They are generated from combination of organic or geometric shapes & color. They can be simple  or complex, they generally appear random to create a particular look and feel.The image textures 

* tantalizes the senses, the eyes like to look at image textures.
* can be like the sense of smell and touch, you can't see anything particular in it.
* triggers feelings of emotions and sensations of touch.
* can be : enviornmental, biological or man-made.
* Enviornmental: Wood, Sand, Grain, Water , Stars
* Biologoical: Skin, Fur, feathers, animal prints
* Man-made: painting, illustration, die, clothes, papers, typography, photographic effects, etc.
* abstract nature  to trigger feelings and excites sense. this can be used to engage sense and add distinct visual tone to a piece of Graphic Design Work.

### Pattern Texture

They are generated from organic or geometrical shapes. They are mainly manufactured.

* They can be simple or complex.
* appear more textured
* repeated formation of shape and color will result in pattern texture. say a repeated logo.
* also tantalizes senses, but in a different way.
* trigger visual senses rather than emotional senses.
* more about visual recognition.
* used and work well in decoration.
* decorative nature serves as a prelude to the excitement, (eagerness to open a gift)

Some of the most iconic styles, eras of design, fashion trends and social media have been defined by their textures: Bauhaus pattern, neoclassical patterns, art deco patterns, psychedelic textures of the 70's, pop textures of the 80's, and hip textures of the 90's etc.

## Space

Space creates visual essence and dynamic of a composition. In designs there are two types of space: Positive Space, Negative Space.

### Positive Space

* Positive Space can be perceived as 2 dimensional or 3 dimensional.
* It refers to the shape of objects. It usually refers to anything considered main focus or the edge.

### Negative Space

* Negative Space or Empty space, is the part of design that is not there. It is the space between visual elements.
* This can also be background color of a design. 
* It can be just as integral to the design as the positive space,
* Negative space is important because it helps frame and contain a composition. It connects or disconnects shapes to suggest relationships between shapes. 
* Negative space avoids visual clutter and looks clean, which can help balance a composition and help focus the viewer on something specific.
* In design, what creates positive and negative space is the arrangement and visual appearance of shapes within a composition.

In 2D design proximity, overlap, opacity, light, shadow and perspective can be applied to shapes to create visual dynamics, i.e., illusion of space and depth on a computer screen. 

**Proximity** is simply the distance shapes are from one another, far apart or close together. Proximity suggests relationship between shapes.

**Overlap** is the effect where shapes are arranged to be on top of each other, this illusion makes top element look closer to the observer.

**Opacity** is the effect where objects appear transparent, degrees of opacity can make elements heavy or light to suggest dominance and order of closeness in a space. Opacity blurs the barriers between positive and negative space. Overlapping transparent elements can create dynamics in a composition, to create a illusion of 3D and perspective.

**Light & Shadow** can give an object a 3 dimensional look and feel. Shadow can create an illusion that an object is on top of another and suggest how far apart they may be.

**Perspective** is created through the arrangement, creation and manipulation of shapes to look like they appear in real life.This is the effect where shapes appear to get smaller further away they get. Perspective can also be achieved through the use of relative sizes of objects, overlapping objects and blurring and sharpening of objects. 

In design, there is no way to determine the depth of the space, only the order of closeness.

In design, we can use positive or negative space to create a focal point, create balance, set a visual tone,and define look and feel.

 Probability is a concept which numerically measures the degree of uncertainity, therefore, the certainity of the occurence of events. 
 
 **Experiment ** - something that produces a well defined outcome.  (something happens), flipping a coin, rolling a dice. 
 
 Deterministic Experiments - the outcome is known before the experiment is performed. => Lab experiments. 
 Random/Stochastic Experiments - Experiments whoose outcome cannot be precisely predicted primarily because of the totality of the factors influencing the outcomes are either or not precisely identifiable or controllable at time of experimentation. 
 
 #### Sample Space (S)
 -  List (set) of all possible outcomes.
 -  The set must be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. 
 -  Art: to be at right granuality. 

For Flip a coin 
S = {H, T}

For Rolling a Die 
S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

**Mutually Exclusive** - at the end, there is only one outcome. 

$$ P(A) \cap P(B) = \phi $$

**Collectively Exclusive** - 

$$ P(A) + P(B) + ... + P(N) = S$$

**Understanding: Art**
Consider sample space, S 
- H and Rain
- T and No Rain
- T and Rain
- T and No-Rain

Now this, is a valid sample space. But the occurence of either  H or T, and Rain or No Rain are totally unrelated. The result of a coin vs whether it will rain? has no relation with each other. The rain outside does not affect the toss of a coin in any possible way.

#### Trial 
A  random experimen may consist of sub-experiments. These are called trials. 

#### Sample Point  
The outcome of the trial. For a random experiment consisting of three successive flips of a coin. Each flip is a trial, while each possible outcome is a sample point, a set of all sample points is the sample space. 
 
 $$ S = \{\{H, H, H\}, \{H, H, T\}, \{H, T, T\}, \{T, T, T\}, \{T, T, H\}, \{T, H, T\}, \{T, H, H\}\}$$

# Seqnuences, and Reccurence Relations

- A `sequence` is a mathematical structure used to study repeated processess. 
- `Mathematical Induction` is the main mathematical tool used to verify conjectures about sequences. Also, Mathematical Induction is a standard proof technique in Computer Science.

A sequence is a function whoose domain is either all the integers between two given integers, or all integers greater than or equal to a given integer. 

For sequence, 

Finite Sequence:       $a_m, a_{m+1}, a_{m+2}, a_{m+3}, ... a_n$
Infinite Sequence:     $a_m, a_{m+1}, a_{m+2}, a_{m+3}, ....$

$a_m$ - is called term     $m$ - is called subscript / index

$a_m$ - Initial Term
$a_n$ - Final term

A sequence can also be defined using an explicit / general formula.  A general formula for a sequence is a rule that shows how the values of $a_k$ depends on $k$.

For given general formula, 

$$
           a_k = \frac{k}{k+1} \hspace{5cm} \forall k \ge 1
$$
The sequence is

$$
   \frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{4}{5}, \ldots
$$

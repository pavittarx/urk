## Summation Notation

The sum from 1 to n can be represeted by summation notation as follows:

$$
   \sum_{i=0}^{n}{i^2} = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n
$$
## Product Notation
The product of numbers from 1 to n can be represented by product notation as follows: 

$$
  \prod_{i=0}^{n} {i} = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times \space ... \times \space n
$$

### Properties of Sum & Product Notations

$$
   \sum_{i=k}^{n}a_i + \sum_{i=k}^{n}{b_i} = \sum_{i=k}^{n}({a_i + b_i})
$$

$$
   c.\sum_{i=k}^{n}{a_i} = \sum_{i=k}^{n}{c.a_i}
$$

$$
  \prod_{i=k}^{n}a_i \times \prod_{i=k}^{n}{b_i} = \prod_{i=k}^{n}({a_i \times b_i})
$$

## Factorial Notation

$$n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \space \cdots \space \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$$

Also, $0! = 1$


### `n choose r` Notation

The symbol ${n \choose r}$ read as "n choose r", represents the number of subsets of size r, that can be choosen from a set with n elements. ($0 \le r \le n$)

For all integers, 

$$
   {n \choose r} = \frac{n!}{r! \times (n-r)!} \hspace{2cm} 0 \le r \le n
$$

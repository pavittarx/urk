## What is a Paragraph? 
A piece of writing is divided into number of paragraphs. The paragraphs are one of the elementary units that are combined together to form larger writing pieces. <br/>
A paragraph is a piece of writing which is unified by a central, controlling idea or theme. This idea/theme is called topic of the paragraph.  The idea is expressed by one sentence in a paragraph, the sentence is called the topic sentence. The topic sentence may be a statement, generalization or a problem. It is most frequently found at the beginning,middle or end of the paragraph.

In some cases, the topic sentence may be hidden within the meaning of the paragraph, and not conveyed explicitly.
In other cases, the topic sentence can also be varied in more than one paragraphs. 

[=] A topic sentence at the beginning helps you & the reader, relate the paragraph to the topic sentence.
A paragraph is supposed to maintain unity with the topic sentence. It is to be made sure that the every sentence directly/indirectly contributes to the central theme/idea

<hr/>

## Basic Organization of a paragraph
The central theme of the paragraph is developed by expanding the idea revolving around the topic sentence.The idea can be expanded by adding more information, examples, explanations, elaboration, illustrations, etc.

### Coherence 
A good paragraph requires more than a topic sentence & supporting details i.e, it must also be coherent. A coherent paragraph is logical & consistent. It slides a reader smoothly from one idea to the next. In a coherent paragraph, a sentence logically leads to the next.

### Transitional Devices
A transitional device is used between sentences to bring out coherence. The transitional devices are the words that helps the writer to transition(move) from one sentence to another logically, it also show logical relationship between them.

Some words/phrases that act as transitional devices: <br>
<b>Result:</b> therefore, as a result, consequently, thus, hence. <br/> 
<b>Examples:</b> for example, for instance, specifically, as an illustration, such as <br/>
<b>Comparison:</b> similarly, likewise, simultaneously <br/>
<b>Contrast:</b> but, yet, still, however, nevertheless, on the contrary, on the other hand, though <br/>
<b>Addition:</b> moreover, furthermore, also, too, besides, in addition <br/>
<b>Time:</b> now, later, meanwhile, since, after that, before that time, meantime, until <br/>
<b>Sequence:</b> first, second, third, next, finally, consecutively

## Development of a Paragraph
It deals with development of different kinds of paragraphs, The development of a paragraph is dependent upon the purpose, topic,and your target audience (readers). <br/>
This can be further divided into two broad categories: <br/>
The  one strictly within the scope of topic. <br/>
The one that involves a second topic, a topic that is comparable (or in contrast) to the central topic. <br/> 

There are no rules governing the development of one kind of paragraph, the entire purpose of the paragraph is to effectively put forward your point, opinion or view regarding the topic. It must be kept in mind, more than one techniques can be combined together to compose a paragraph. 

### Illustration
The topic is illustrated with the help of examples, it gives the reader understanding of a difficult or rather abstract theme or idea. It also helps the author to convince the reader about the factual correctness of the topic, since he is providing examples supporting the topic. <br/> 
An illustration usually starts with transitional devices:  For example, For instance, such as, etc.

### Description 
A description is concerned with the detail of central idea, a description is usually to describe your theme, in more words. A complete description may not be mandatory in a single paragraph, but it may be needful in larger composition like, letter, emails, report/s, narratives, blogs etc. 

The items usually included in description are: <br/>
* Position, Place, Direction <br/>
* Measure: Weight, Size, Volume, Distance <br/>
* Design, Shapes & Patterns <br/>
* Colors & Textures <br/>
* Materials & Substances <br/>

In some descriptions, usually involving navigation, scenes, landscapes, you may need to arrange your details by using: 
beneath, above, beyond, below, under, over, between, in the center, opposite, surrounding, alongside, etc. <br/>
to the right/left/top/bottom, to the east/west/north/south, on the eastern/western/northern /southern end, along the left/right side, etc.

### Cause and Effect
This is another technique that you can use to compose your paragraphs. It is usually about describing the cause that leads to the central theme, and its consequences. 

<b> Cause: </b> A cause is the reason of existence of our central idea. A cause can be difficult to determine and there can be several reasons for the existence of our central theme/idea. <br/>
For instance, a dog biting a person can be reasoned with <br/>
* The person did something to the dog that annoyed him. <br/>
* The person was trespassing the property of his owner. <br/>
* The dog is of cruel nature, he bites anyone except his owner. <br/> 
* The dog was scared of the person, and thought he will be causing harm to him.

These kind of patterns can be followed while writing your paragraphs. You can trace chain of events in which A causes B, B leads to C and so on. The causes can be parellel to each other, with no connection to each other, like the one in above case. A good strategy when dealing with parallel causes is that, you can begin with the least important cause and conclude with the most important  one.

The following points should be kept in mind while dealing with causes/reasons - <br/>
* It should be clear to the reader that the current cause is a immediate/earlier cause. <br/>
* More than one causes should be considered. <br/> 
* All the links between the causes should be accounted in a logical sequence. <br/>
* All the causes should be written about with appropriate detail.

<br/>
<b>Effect:</b> The effect/consequence is the aftermath when the central idea came into existence. In other words, the central idea is the cause to the effect. Similarly as with the cause, the central idea can have more than one consequences, these consequences can be related or in parallel to each other. You must distinguish between the major and minor ones, and write your paragraphs accordingly. <br/> <br/>
[=] It must be noted, the cause & effect are more closely related when forming a chain, in an example where A leads to B, and B to C. Here B is the cause to C, while it is the consequence to A. 

### Definition
If our paragraphs contains terms that our target audience might not be familiar with, we may need to describe it to them. It is most certainly with the technical terms or when we need to describe our own terms. <br/> 
The simplest way to define our terms is by the use of a synonym or placing it in a general class, and then distinguishing between the two. For example, General, a soldier of highest ranking in the army. The term ‘soldier’ is the generalization of of the General. 
Such definitions are rather formal in style, and usually found in the dictionaries. It will be vague to define some concepts/ideas in the same manner, so they may need extended/detailed definitions. For instance, terms like democracy, literate, etc. <br/>
The definitions are extended with addition of details such as, its uses, components, examples, merits, demerits, comparison with similar things, and differentiation them from others. <br/>

[=] The definition can exist within a paragraph, or can be the central theme or idea of the paragraph.

### Comparison and Contrast
A topic can be expressed by showing how it is similar to/different from other topics, the comparison and contrast deals with such form of writing. The comparison & contrast are common devices in writing and it also somehow relates to our thought process. We practically apply this when we tend to make decisions.

The general purpose of comparison/contrast between two topics/items is - <br/>
* To point out distinctions in order to give information about two things. <br/>
* To clarify the unfamiliar unfamiliar by comparing it with the familiar. <br/>
* To show the superiority of a thing over the other.

There are two ways to compare/contrast two things.

1. To write down all the things about first idea/item, & then compare it with the other. <br/>
2. To write down points and compare/contrast them in parallel.

## Advanced Development of Paragraphs

This unit shows some techniques/principles of organizing paragraphs i.e., Chronological [Time] Sequence, Spatial Relationships & Class Relationships. 

### Chronological (Time) Sequence 
The events are arranged in relation to order they occur in time. It usually starts by beginning from first event, and following till the last event. <br/> 
It is used when we tell a simple story (narrative), biological sketch, report incidents and events, describe a process. <br/>

### Spatial Relationships
The paragraphs also can be organized according to space relationships. This usually includes writing about location of a place with respect to others, describing a landscape, or plans for a tactic/strategy. In simple words, it is about describing how objects are connected to each other. <br/>
In spatial sequence, a object/process is described as per physical arrangement of its features.

There is no right pattern for spatial development, you can follow a top-bottom, side-to-side or any other approach of your choice. The only thing that matters is, you should present your subject in a space that is suited to what you are trying to say about your subject. 
 
The paragraphs involving spatial relationships, their description is likely to include: <br/>
* Direction (up, down, left, right, north, east, west, south) <br/>
* Shape (circle, square, rectangle, square) <br/>
* Dimensions (length, width, height) <br/>
* Proportion (half, full, one-third, empty) <br/>

### Class Relationships 
It is human nature to describe the word in different ways, one of them is using a class. A class can represent a represent a relationship among objects/ideas, it classifies them into different groups, as per their similarities and differences. <br/>
The classification is dependent on the purpose of writing, a letter written by a school boy to a scientist will have different classification in comparison to a researcher working in a particular field. Generally, it is based on conventions used by others, and on the purpose of writing. <br/>
For Instance, traditional historical periods has been divided into: Ancient, Medieval, Renaissance, 17th century, 18th Century, Modern. 

Some important points to note, while using class relationships to write your paragraphs - <br/>
* Only one principle of classification should be used, i.e., one main characteristic should be used to classify objects of same class. <br/>
* Be consistent i.e., stick to your classification after you have decided upon your characteristic of classification. Using different of classification will cause only confusion. <br/>
* The categories should be complete in itself. In simpler terms, the object/idea should be fit into the class it has been adopted to. <br/>
* In cases, where you fall into long lists of categories, you should consider generalising your classification a little. <br/>
* The classification categories/groups can overlap in regards to some characteristic, that is they can have some similarities with each other rather being extremely distinct.

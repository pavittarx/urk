## Organization of a Composition
This unit deals with selection of a topic and then planning of writing a composition but before planning the composition, this is what you should keep in mind.
* Your target readers.
* The interests of your targeted readers. 
* The level of their comfortableness with the topic and language.
* Sufficient information to write a number of paragraphs, to define, elaborate & illustrate your central idea or theme.

### Decide Your Topic 
The choice of a suitable is dependent on your target reader. You should know whether the composition is to be read by a child, a professional/specialist, or a simple adult. <br/>
The topics can be collected from -
* A field of your interest, searching on the internet.
* A simple talk with a friend can raise interesting topics, provide insights on them. 
* A particular interest of yours, a hobby, sports, arts, about a book you are reading.
* A concern about a happening in your surroundings, something you feel compelled to write about.

A serious topic that requires greater detail and backing up with facts, you should visit library/archives, read books, or contact a person in the specific field.

A topic can be searched for arbitrarily at various places, but the following points should be kept in mind while choosing a topic. <br/>
* Choose a topic you feel strongly about, such that you should enjoy writing about it, and it is more convincing rather than an alien topic you are not interested in.
* The topic should belong to the subject you have sufficient knowledge about.
* If the subject doesn’t spark an interest in you, find one that does and choose a topic from it.

### Limit Your Topic
If a topic is too general in nature, it is supposed to cover a broad area. It is hard to manage and organize such a composition, since there is loads of information. It also becomes to back up idea with examples and illustrations. <br/> 
A composition written on a broad topic usually ends up becoming - 
* An organized mess of paragraphs, where each paragraph discusses different aspects of same subject. 
* The main idea of topic remains unattended and lack necessary detail.

This makes it necessary to limit your topic, and reduce the scope of your composition. Limiting your topic will omit unnecessary matter and make it easier to strike out only essential details needed for the composition.

### Gather and Order Information
The limiting process might get you closer and strict details of what you intend to write about. You may also have collected a sufficient amount of information while deciding & limiting your topic. Since, there many ways in which you can gather information, you must also be aware that your self thought can also be one of the richest sources of information on the topic.

The facts are needed to be arranged in a particular order after you are done collecting them. It should be arranged in a manner that it brings a clear meaning to your topic about your composition. The arrangement of facts is necessary because 
* The facts that are not related to your theme are needed to be discarded.
* There may be unwanted information that you may not want to write about.
* The information you may have gathered will be so common that it will only dull down your composition.
* A single idea may have been repeated multiple times.
* It may also lead you to discover if you are short on information for writing about the topic.

The items/facts should be arranged together in order of their relation with each other. It can be dependent upon how similar or contrasting an item is with other. 

### Construct an Outline 
This is a stage before you actually start writing your composition. An outline acts as a roadmap, it helps you directly reach to your goal without the need to waste your time & effort. An outline helps you as 
* It eradicates the need to revise your composition too often.
* It strictly keeps you on your topic.
* It restricts you from repeating the matter.
* It makes it easier to write complicated compositions.

## Guidelines - Composition Writing

* A paragraph should begin whenever there is a major change in the subject.
* A paragraph should discuss the idea of topic sentence in full detail.
* A paragraph should be of substantial length. It should neither be too short, such that it leaves the topic undiscussed, nor should it be so long that it confuses the reader by piling up ideas.
* There should be a link between a paragraph to the other, such that transition from a paragraph to another is smooth enough.
* The paragraphs of the composition should be close in length to each other.

The guidelines to be followed while choosing a title.

## Major Components of a Composition
Each composition has at least these three major components.
- Introduction/ Beginning/ Opening Paragraph
- Body 
- Conclusion/ Ending

## Introduction
The introduction of a composition is not limited to a single paragraph, it can be a single sentence or a number of paragraphs. The length of introduction depends solely upon the topic and the length of composition. There are compositions where an introduction is not be required.

The introduction states the main idea of the composition, this can be done in various ways depending upon the purpose of composition, which comes down to the type of composition being used.

The points to note when writing an introduction 
* It should arouse the interest and curiosity of the reader.
* Start straight to the point of the topic rather than going with some broad general statements. It is advisable to assume your reader has background knowledge about the topic. 
* Begin with short factual sentence. It will engage the thoughts of the reader and want him to read more.
* Use a funny remark, metaphor, analogy, anecdote, quotation or a simile to amuse the reader.

### The Body

The introductory paragraph has stated the topic, limited and also aroused the interest and curiosity of the reader.The body of the composition is what comes next, the concern of `the body` is to develop the topic. The use of language should be concentrated upon to express your thoughts as it will allow your reader to follow the flow of your thought in the composition. <br/>
The two ways language can be used to give clarity and unity to your ideas are. 

<b>Signpost </b> <br/>
It guides your reader through the composition. These are words or phrases that can allow the reader to align with the writer’s thoughts. <br/>
* Topic sentences become signposts through a composition.
* The signposts can also be words or phrases that tell the reader about the sequence or design of the composition.
* Paragraphs and indentation of quotations also act as a signpost to the reader.


<b> Inter Paragraph Transitions </b> <br/>
These are also important to help the writer in linking the flow of ideas in a composition. The inter paragraph transitions are words or phrases which tie beginning of a paragraph to the last paragraph before the current one.


Every paragraph indicates some change in thought from the earlier one, so it is crucial to link the ideas expressed in two paragraphs. The two paragraphs can be linked together with the use of - 

* <b> Repetition: </b> A keyword/phrase is repeated at the beginning of new paragraph from the end of preceding one.
* <b>Question and Answer Transition: </b> The question comes at the end of last sentence and the answer is first sentence in the next paragraph. 
* The opening sentence summarized the idea of previous paragraph in a phrase or clause. The main clause which follows states the topic of the new paragraph. If and while are generally used in this case. 
* The pronouns such as this, that, these, those can be used to refer to the key noun in the previous paragraph. These words can also be used as determiners modifying a word or phrase.
* Words or phrases showing logical relationships such as therefore, however, consequently, but, then, so, even so, on the other hand, in contrast to that, in addition, meanwhile, etc. can be used.

### The Ending
The last impression in a paragraph is as important as the first one. The final paragraph is what the reader tends to remember and gives the most attention to. These paragraphs should include anything to everything you want the reader to remember suggestions, ideas, impressions, opinions, judgements, predictions etc.

The beginning of the paragraph introduces, engages and creates curiosity so the ending should tie up, or summarize the main ideas so far. 
* The ending paragraph should let the reader recall all the main points of the composition.
* The theme in the opening paragraph should be repeated to convince the reader, you have proved your point.
* An ending can suggest a remedy or course of action.
* An ending can offer a value judgement.
* An ending can provide a prediction, by giving a thought ahead based on the topic discussed in the composition.
* In descriptive/narrative composition the end comes naturally at the end of description or narration.

The following should not be done in respect to the ending paragraph in your composition.
* A new topic should not be introduced at the ending of the paragraph, it should strengthen ideas presented in the composition.
* The words or phrases like: in short, Finally, to sum up, in conclusion, I end by saying, now I can conclude that. They reduce the force of the idea that follows.
